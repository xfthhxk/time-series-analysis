;; # Random Walk
;; A random walk is defined using equation:
(clerk/tex "
\\begin{alignedat}{2}
y_{t} = y_{t-1} + C + \\epsilon_{t}
\\end{alignedat}
")

;; where C is a constant and a random number epsilon represents white noise.
;; As an example, we'll start at `y = 0` and set `C = 0`, then the random walk
;; is essentially the sum of each epislon at time *t*.

(clerk/tex "
\\begin{alignedat}{2}
y_{t} = \\sum_{\\mathclap{t = 1}}^{T} \\epsilon_{t}
\\end{alignedat}
")

(def steps-clj
  (let [d (-> random/default-normal
              (random/set-seed! 42))]
    (->> (repeatedly 1000 #(random/sample d))
         (into [0]))))


;; However we'll use the Python generated data with seed 42 since the seeds don't seem to produce the same data.

;; A random walk is a series whose first difference is stationary and uncorrelated.
;; Stationary requires a constant mean, variance and autocorrelation over time.

;; **Differencing** is the simplest transformation that will make a time series stationary. The formula
;; is as follows and is essentially a delta between the y values.

\\begin{alignedat}{2}

;; Logarithms stabilize the variance.

;; Forecasting a random walk on a long horizon does not make sense.
